# DannFlow Setup Flows

This document covers every path from "fresh start" to "fully Claude-configured project." Three flows: new project, update, and migrating an existing project.

---

## Flow 1 — New Project

**Trigger:** `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danncode10/DannFlow/main/install.sh | bash`

What `install.sh` does automatically:
1. Clones DannFlow → installs npm deps → copies `.env.example` → `.env.local`
2. Installs Ruflo globally; run `npx ruflo@latest init wizard` separately if you choose to use Ruflo
3. Downloads all 8 skill packs (design taste, quality, SEO/marketing)
4. Runs `./guide.sh init` (rebrand + Git history reset)

**What you do after install (in Claude Code):**

```
Step 1 — Configure GitHub MCP and Supabase MCP
  Follow mcp-setup.md and verify the GitHub connection can access Projects.

Step 2 — Run /new-project
  Describe the SaaS, rebrand the repository, connect Supabase, migrate tracked schema,
  and verify generated types. The non-secret Supabase project reference stays in .env.local.

Step 3 — Create a GitHub Project yourself
  Choose Kanban/Board layout (not Draft) and add Status values:
  Backlog, Ready, In progress, Done.

Step 4 — Run /masterplan-init
  Detects the initialized SaaS, links the existing Kanban Project, creates detailed
  Phase 0, and syncs Phase 0 cards. It stops safely if it cannot find a suitable board.

Step 5 — Run /what-task
  Choose the first Phase 0 task. Expand Phase 1 later with /make-masterplan Phase 1.
```

After initialization, use `/what-task` to start the current Phase 0 work. `/make-masterplan` is for expanding later phases, not creating the initial plan.

## Database setup for contributors

DannFlow uses Supabase for hosted Postgres/Auth and Drizzle for schema authoring. The database source of truth is:

```text
db/schema/*.ts
```

Generated files are:

```text
db/migrations/*.sql
src/types/supabase.ts
supabase/backups/*.sql
```

For a fresh local clone, run:

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm db:setup
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm db:setup` starts local Supabase, applies every migration in `db/migrations/`, and regenerates `src/types/supabase.ts` from the local database. This gives every contributor the same database shape without requiring access to Dann's hosted Supabase project.

Use these commands while developing:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pnpm db:setup` | Start local Supabase, reset the local DB, apply migrations, and generate local types. |
| `pnpm db:generate <name>` | Generate a SQL migration in `db/migrations/` from `db/schema/*.ts`. |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply `db/migrations/` to Supabase using `DATABASE_URL` and refresh remote types. |
| `pnpm db:types` | Regenerate `src/types/supabase.ts` from the local DB. |
| `pnpm db:types:remote` | Regenerate types from the hosted project using `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`. |

The normal schema loop is:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
# edit db/schema/*.ts
pnpm db:generate add_feature_tables
# review the generated SQL
pnpm db:migrate
```

### What belongs in SQL migrations?

Drizzle owns tables, columns, indexes, and relations. Supabase-specific features such as RLS policies, auth triggers, functions, storage buckets, extensions, and grants still belong in the generated SQL migrations as explicit SQL. Review those migrations before applying them.

---

## Flow 2 — Update Existing DannFlow Project

**Trigger:** `/init-update` in Claude Code (or `./guide.sh init-update` equivalent)

What `/init-update` does:
- Pulls latest commands, guide.sh, npm scripts, docs from the DannFlow repo
- Shows diffs and asks per-category before applying
- Checks ruflo memory for customizations before overwriting (Step 0)

**What you do after update:**

```
Step 1 — Run /ruflo-upgrade
  /init-update may have regenerated command files, wiping Ruflo patterns.
  /ruflo-upgrade restores them in one shot. Always run this after updates.

Step 2 — Run /no-conflict
  Verify the update didn't introduce documentation drift.

Step 3 — Run /init-claude (if major version update)
  Only needed if the DannFlow stack changed significantly.
  It will re-read your README and re-tailor the environment.
```

---

## Flow 3 — Existing Project (No DannFlow Tooling)

Use this when you have an existing Next.js / Supabase project and want to add DannFlow's Claude tooling without starting over.

**Trigger:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Danncode10/DannFlow/main/install-add.sh | bash
```

What `install-add.sh` does:
- Downloads `.claude/` (commands, CLAUDE.md, SKILLS.md), `guide.sh`, `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- Merges into your existing project — **never touches `src/`, `package.json`, `.env.local`, or your database**
- Installs Ruflo globally + registers MCP
- Downloads all 8 skill packs

**What you do after (same 5 steps as Flow 1):**

```
Step 1 — Edit README.md    (describe YOUR project)
Step 2 — Run /init-claude  (tailors everything to your project)
Step 3 — Fill PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
Step 4 — Run /ruflo-upgrade
Step 5 — Run /no-conflict
```

## The key files and what they do

| File | What it is | Who writes it | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Project pitch and feature set | **You** | `/init-claude`, Claude at session start |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude's authoritative project config | `/init-claude` + you | Every command, every session |
| `SKILLS.md` | Which skills are relevant + when | `/init-claude` | Claude when choosing a skill |
| `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` | Project-specific decisions (audience, stack, design, tone) | **You** | Skills + commands before acting |
| `.claude/commands/*.md` | Slash command definitions | DannFlow + `/init-claude` | Claude when you run `/command` |
| `src/types/supabase.ts` | Auto-generated Supabase types | `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:types`, or `pnpm db:types:remote` | All service files + Claude |

---

## Why PROJECT_CONTEXT.md exists

DannFlow ships with 8 skill packs from GitHub. Skills are updated by `./guide.sh skills-update`. If you edited a skill file directly, the update would overwrite your edits.

Instead: put project-specific context in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. All skills and commands read `CLAUDE.md` + `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` before acting. You get project-specific behavior without ever touching a skill file.

## Quick reference

```bash
# New project
curl -sSL .../install.sh | bash
# → configure GitHub + Supabase MCP → /new-project → create Kanban Project → /masterplan-init

# Existing project after its product context is complete
curl -sSL .../install-add.sh | bash
# → then /init-claude → configure required MCPs → create Kanban Project → /masterplan-init

# After any update
/init-update → /ruflo-upgrade → /no-conflict

# If Claude environment drifts
/init-claude   → re-tailors everything to current project state
/ruflo-upgrade → restores memory + parallel patterns
/no-conflict   → verifies docs match code
```

## Related commands

| Command | When to use |
|---|---|
| `/init-claude` | Tailor Claude environment to current project state. Run after install, after major updates, or when CLAUDE.md drifts significantly. |
| `/ruflo-upgrade` | Re-apply Ruflo memory + parallel-agent patterns to 12 core commands. Run after any update that regenerates command files. |
| `/no-conflict` | Audit docs vs. actual code. Run as the final step of any setup or update flow. |
| `/init-update` | Pull latest DannFlow commands, scripts, and docs while preserving your code. |
| `/sync-commands` | Lighter audit — checks only command docs for orphans and stale entries. |
| `/auto-docs` | Broadest audit — commands, skills, npm scripts, env vars, stack, and folder structure. |
